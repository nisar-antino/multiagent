## CGST, SGST, and IGST - Tax Structure

### Intra-State Supply (Within Same State)
For supplies within the same state:
- **CGST (Central GST)** - Collected by Central Government
- **SGST (State GST)** - Collected by State Government

**Both CGST and SGST are levied at equal rates.**

**Example:** For an 18% tax rate:
- CGST = 9%
- SGST = 9%
- Total = 18%

### Inter-State Supply (Between Different States)
For supplies between different states:
- **IGST (Integrated GST)** - Collected by Central Government

**Example:** For an 18% tax rate:
- IGST = 18%

### Place of Supply Determination
The place of supply determines whether a transaction is intra-state or inter-state:
- If supplier and recipient are in the same state → Intra-state (CGST + SGST)
- If supplier and recipient are in different states → Inter-state (IGST)
